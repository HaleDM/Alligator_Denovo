Ambystoma Project Notes: 

7/23/18
-Discussing particular ways to move files into Sapelo for analysis. Sbock and Ebertucci were
planning to use wget or curl to download directly from dropbox, which made our goals from
last week seem confusing
-Need to become more familiar with interactive/login nodes and how to properly move around
and submit jobs
-New rotation student might be involved with this project, starting next week (maybe)
-For next week, goals are to 1.) get files into lustre 2.) run QC for a. rCorrector and
 b. TrimGalore/CutAdapt
 
7/30/18
-Discussed TrimGalore and rCorrector use and output, particularly how to use python script
to clean up rCorrector output and how to interpret the TrimGalore adapter contamination
-After discussing as a group and learning that the default setting for TrimGalore is to remove
adapter sequences with a single basepair of overlap, we decided to rerun TrimGalore with this
default setting relaxed to 3 basepair overlap.

8/6/18
-BBP looks into the possible biases and cost/benefit of adapter trimming and the different
thresholds which we set to start removing basepairs. Limiting the minimum overlap to 3 means
that we will be trimming 1/56 reads that naturally start/end with AGA, for example (an Illumina
adapter). At the 5' end of reads, this trimming might negatively influence transcript assembly
by clipping the TSS. 
-Moving weekly meetings to Thursday at 9AM, except for next week, which will be Friday at 9AM.
-Goal for next week is to 1.) initiate alignment in Hisat2 for Emily and for Samantha's guided
assembly process 2.) initiate assembly in Trinity for Matthew and Ben.
-Trinity has some functionality for both GO assignment and DEG analysis. Make sure to keep this
in mind.
-Also need to use Integrated Genome Viewer (IGV) to determine if our reads are stranded or not.
Stranded reads in IGV will exhibit a distinct pattern wherein read density falls on one strand
or the other. This can be visualized using a .BAM file generated after alignment (from MDH's prior
Hisat2 alignment).

8/21/18
-Going to use Detonate to compare assembly quality across our different approaches
-MDH brought up possible assembly quality issues, wherein when mapping individual reads
back to a sample assembly (for just one sample), very few read pairs mapped together, but 
this highlighted a fundamental misunderstanding in the correct way to use Trinity to generate
assemblies in DEG analysis. That is, ALL reads across ALL samples, are used to generate a single assembly, 
then individual samples are mapped back to this assembly. This could possibly address the 
poor pair mapping MDH reported.
-Move forward with using Trinity to generate assemblies for all samples. EMB is moving forward
with reference-guided assembly process.
-Found a small hiccup, wherein the Amiss. genome index being used by EMB and SLB wasn't using
splice site annotations. Unsure what impact this will (or won't) have downstream application.

9/6/18
-Goal for the week is annotating Trinity assembly both with Trinotate and Blastx for Ben and Matthew,
getting assembly running for Samantha.

10/26/18
WThompson: researching best way to do trimming and correcting on reads
-Running TrimGalore with default overlap set to 3
-Our pre-Trinity pipeline is:
1.) Reads from GGBC
2.) fastQC to get QA for raw, unchanged reads
3.) Send reads to rCorrector and Harvard python script
4.) Send corrected reads to TrimGalore
5.) Send corrected, trimmed reads to Trinity.
-Get the foundation SOLID for the quality of reads on Will's end, and next week launch Trinity

EBertucci:
-Working on Medaka, all the way count matrix with gene names. Now working on getting edgeR running
-Figuring out trimming and library size normalizations down. Wants to get contrasts running
 and DEGs 
-BBP wants to be able to include effects like mesocosm in the model
-EBertucci and MDH will work through the contrasts today

11/2/18
WThompson
-TrimGalore isn't spitting out the FastQC like he's specifying, unsure why
-Can go back and run FastQC independently if FastQC-in-TrimGalore isn't working
-Goal is to get around the FastQC block

MHale
-PoSSum-Search to identify enrichment of motifs in the genome
-Don't go down the Cufflinks rabbit-hole
-Venny, online program to identify shared gene features from 2+ lists

SBock
-Not doing much Seq/Omics right now, but found a cool paper in Daphnia using RRBS
 to study transgenerational effects (of what)
 
EBertucci
-Figuring out how to specify meaningful contrasts and main effects in DEG analysis
-Found a way to append MSTRG identifiers with gene names and ref_gene names in StringTie!

11/9/18
EBertucci
-RNAseq analysis on LoDif (medaka)
-Main effects are working, but plotMDS in edgeR shows one of the mesocosms as being a big
 outlier. Two approaches to fixing are 1.) blocking and 2.) batch effect controlling. The
 blocking effect seems to work. MDH should look into using blocking for clutch. In other
 news, RRBS reads came back from GGBC, but ~40% of reads were lost/didn't work.
 
SBock
-Ecoinformatics: trying to access large climate data sets from a remote server from
 32 different climate models (run from 2006 to 2099)
 
MDH 
-Take the 10 overlapping AP and WO basal enriched genes (the ones that are shared that
 CAN'T BE SHARED) and track down the MSTRGs for those, then blast/blat them to see
 if they're the same gene
-Can still do the 2nd-pass assembly with the perl script, but is secondary and won't fix
 all the problems we have
-See notes from 11/14 lab meeting!
 
WThompson
-QC with FastQC after trimming is up and running. Working through some quality flags in
 FastQC, but flags are familiar -- per base sequence content in the first 12bp and sequence
 duplication levels
