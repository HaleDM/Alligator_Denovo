Ambystoma Project Notes: 

7/23/18
-Discussing particular ways to move files into Sapelo for analysis. Sbock and Ebertucci were
planning to use wget or curl to download directly from dropbox, which made our goals from
last week seem confusing
-Need to become more familiar with interactive/login nodes and how to properly move around
and submit jobs
-New rotation student might be involved with this project, starting next week (maybe)
-For next week, goals are to 1.) get files into lustre 2.) run QC for a. rCorrector and
 b. TrimGalore/CutAdapt
 
7/30/18
-Discussed TrimGalore and rCorrector use and output, particularly how to use python script
to clean up rCorrector output and how to interpret the TrimGalore adapter contamination
-After discussing as a group and learning that the default setting for TrimGalore is to remove
adapter sequences with a single basepair of overlap, we decided to rerun TrimGalore with this
default setting relaxed to 3 basepair overlap.
