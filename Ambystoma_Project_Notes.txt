Ambystoma Project Notes: 

7/23/18
-Discussing particular ways to move files into Sapelo for analysis. Sbock and Ebertucci were
planning to use wget or curl to download directly from dropbox, which made our goals from
last week seem confusing
-Need to become more familiar with interactive/login nodes and how to properly move around
and submit jobs
-New rotation student might be involved with this project, starting next week (maybe)
-For next week, goals are to 1.) get files into lustre 2.) run QC for a. rCorrector and
 b. TrimGalore/CutAdapt
 
7/30/18
-Discussed TrimGalore and rCorrector use and output, particularly how to use python script
to clean up rCorrector output and how to interpret the TrimGalore adapter contamination
-After discussing as a group and learning that the default setting for TrimGalore is to remove
adapter sequences with a single basepair of overlap, we decided to rerun TrimGalore with this
default setting relaxed to 3 basepair overlap.

8/6/18
-BBP looks into the possible biases and cost/benefit of adapter trimming and the different
thresholds which we set to start removing basepairs. Limiting the minimum overlap to 3 means
that we will be trimming 1/56 reads that naturally start/end with AGA, for example (an Illumina
adapter). At the 5' end of reads, this trimming might negatively influence transcript assembly
by clipping the TSS. 
-Moving weekly meetings to Thursday at 9AM, except for next week, which will be Friday at 9AM.
-Goal for next week is to 1.) initiate alignment in Hisat2 for Emily and for Samantha's guided
assembly process 2.) initiate assembly in Trinity for Matthew and Ben.
-Trinity has some functionality for both GO assignment and DEG analysis. Make sure to keep this
in mind.
-Also need to use Integrated Genome Viewer (IGV) to determine if our reads are stranded or not.
Stranded reads in IGV will exhibit a distinct pattern wherein read density falls on one strand
or the other. This can be visualized using a .BAM file generated after alignment (from MDH's prior
Hisat2 alignment).

8/21/18
-Going to use Detonate to compare assembly quality across our different approaches
-MDH brought up possible assembly quality issues, wherein when mapping individual reads
back to a sample assembly (for just one sample), very few read pairs mapped together, but 
this highlighted a fundamental misunderstanding in the correct way to use Trinity to generate
assemblies in DEG analysis. That is, ALL reads across ALL samples, are used to generate a single assembly, 
then individual samples are mapped back to this assembly. This could possibly address the 
poor pair mapping MDH reported.
-Move forward with using Trinity to generate assemblies for all samples. EMB is moving forward
with reference-guided assembly process.
-Found a small hiccup, wherein the Amiss. genome index being used by EMB and SLB wasn't using
splice site annotations. Unsure what impact this will (or won't) have downstream application.

9/6/18
-Goal for the week is annotating Trinity assembly both with Trinotate and Blastx for Ben and Matthew,
getting assembly running for Samantha.
