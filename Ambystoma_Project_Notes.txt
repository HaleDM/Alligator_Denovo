Ambystoma Project Notes: 

7/23/18
-Discussing particular ways to move files into Sapelo for analysis. Sbock and Ebertucci were
planning to use wget or curl to download directly from dropbox, which made our goals from
last week seem confusing
-Need to become more familiar with interactive/login nodes and how to properly move around
and submit jobs
-New rotation student might be involved with this project, starting next week (maybe)
-For next week, goals are to 1.) get files into lustre 2.) run QC for a. rCorrector and
 b. TrimGalore/CutAdapt
 
7/30/18
-Discussed TrimGalore and rCorrector use and output, particularly how to use python script
to clean up rCorrector output and how to interpret the TrimGalore adapter contamination
-After discussing as a group and learning that the default setting for TrimGalore is to remove
adapter sequences with a single basepair of overlap, we decided to rerun TrimGalore with this
default setting relaxed to 3 basepair overlap.

8/6/18
-BBP looks into the possible biases and cost/benefit of adapter trimming and the different
thresholds which we set to start removing basepairs. Limiting the minimum overlap to 3 means
that we will be trimming 1/56 reads that naturally start/end with AGA, for example (an Illumina
adapter). At the 5' end of reads, this trimming might negatively influence transcript assembly
by clipping the TSS. 
-Moving weekly meetings to Thursday at 9AM, except for next week, which will be Friday at 9AM.
-Goal for next week is to 1.) initiate alignment in Hisat2 for Emily and for Samantha's guided
assembly process 2.) initiate assembly in Trinity for Matthew and Ben.
-Trinity has some functionality for both GO assignment and DEG analysis. Make sure to keep this
in mind.
-Also need to use Integrated Genome Viewer (IGV) to determine if our reads are stranded or not.
Stranded reads in IGV will exhibit a distinct pattern wherein read density falls on one strand
or the other. This can be visualized using a .BAM file generated after alignment (from MDH's prior
Hisat2 alignment).
